## Details

### Ledger Protocol Cleanup (10:05 PM - 10:10 PM)
- **Read planning documents:**
  - LedgerProtocol.md
  - AI_Trainer_GDD_v1.0.md
  - Previous ledger entries (10_24_2025_740PM.md, 10_24_2025_945PM.md)
  - Reviewed existing index.html created in previous session

- **Ledger Protocol Cleanup Completed:**
  - Created living_ledger_archive directory
  - Copied both previous session ledgers (10_24_2025_740PM.md and 10_24_2025_945PM.md) into MASTER_LEDGER.md (newest first)
  - Moved both processed ledgers to living_ledger_archive folder
  - Created new session ledger for current session (10_24_2025_1005PM.md)

### Index.html Edits and Improvements (10:10 PM - 10:40 PM)
- **File reorganization:**
  - Moved index.html from root to Marketing/Website/ folder for better project organization
  - Updated all image paths from root-relative to nested-relative (`../../Art/...`)

- **Content updates per Director's request:**
  1. Removed yellow-orange gradient background from hero banner - cover art now displays cleanly
  2. Removed entire "Explore the World" section (Industrial Drury, Drury Forest, Seaside District)
  3. Added BattleScene1.png in new "Battle Your Robots" section
  4. Added 7th Life Studios logo to footer
  5. Updated navigation from "World" to "Battle"

- **Accessibility features implemented:**
  1. **Enhanced Interactive Fonts:**
     - Implemented "Righteous" font for headings (bold, exciting)
     - Implemented "Poppins" font for body text (clean, legible)
     - Added glow effects on hover with color-matched shadows
     - Logo-complemented color scheme (coral #FF6B6B, teal #4ECDC4)
     - Interactive highlights with transform and scale effects
     - Smooth 0.3s ease transitions throughout

  2. **Dark/Light Mode Toggle:**
     - Created toggle button with moon/sun icon (fixed top-right position)
     - Implemented CSS custom properties for complete color system
     - Dark mode uses deep blues/purples with enhanced contrast
     - Both modes verified for proper contrast ratios
     - Persistent preference saved in localStorage

  3. **Dyslexia-Friendly Font Mode:**
     - Integrated OpenDyslexic font (specifically designed for dyslexic readers)
     - Enhanced spacing: letter-spacing (0.05em), word-spacing (0.16em)
     - Improved line-height (1.8) for easier reading
     - Comic Sans MS fallback font
     - Persistent preference saved in localStorage

  4. **Full Responsive Design:**
     - Mobile phones (≤480px): Single column, larger touch targets
     - Tablets (481-768px): Optimized grid layouts
     - Laptops (769-1024px): Multi-column responsive grids
     - Desktop (1025-1919px): Full-width experience
     - 4K displays (≥1920px): Enhanced max-width with larger text
     - Landscape mode: Special adjustments for short screens
     - Auto-fit grids ensure cards adapt to any screen size
     - Orientation-aware handling for both portrait and landscape

### GitHub Pages Deployment Fix (10:40 PM - 10:50 PM)
- **Issue identified:**
  - GitHub Pages build failing due to Jekyll processing
  - Jekyll encountering invalid UTF-8 characters in ledger markdown files
  - Build error prevented site deployment

- **Solution implemented:**
  - Moved index.html back to repository root (required by GitHub Pages)
  - Updated all image paths from `../../Art/...` to `AiTrainer/Art/...`
  - Created `.nojekyll` file to bypass Jekyll processing
  - All 8 image references updated correctly

- **Deployment configuration:**
  - Source: Deploy from branch
  - Branch: main
  - Folder: / (root)
  - Site URL: https://osterling1.github.io/Project_BotPop/

### WebGame Asset Audit (10:50 PM - 11:00 PM)
- **Created comprehensive audit document:**
  - File: `AiTrainer/Docs/Audits/WebGame_Asset_Audit_10_24_2025.md`
  - Catalogued all 70 assets in WebGame folder
  - Organized by category: BackGround (10), Bots (8), Enemy (9), Player (10), UI (29), MockScences (4)

- **Audit includes:**
  - Complete folder structure diagram
  - Individual asset descriptions (one sentence each)
  - Summary statistics and counts
  - Asset readiness assessment
  - Recommendations for external agent
  - Notes on missing assets, duplicates, and naming conventions
  - Animation set completeness verification
  - UI component availability checklist

- **Key findings:**
  - Total of 70 assets ready for web implementation
  - Complete animation sets for all character types
  - Full UI component library available
  - 4 mock scenes showing complete battle UI integration
  - Identified 1 missing enemy sprite file in sequence
  - Noted duplicate text box files needing clarification
  - Flagged 1 file with non-standard naming convention

---

## Roadblocks
- GitHub Pages initially failed to deploy due to Jekyll processing UTF-8 errors in ledger files
- Resolution: Created `.nojekyll` file to bypass Jekyll entirely

---

## Potential Problems
- **Deployment pending:** `.nojekyll` and updated index.html need to be committed and pushed to GitHub
- **Asset gaps:** External agent will need to address missing enemy sprite `_0003s_0004` in sequence
- **Audio missing:** WebGame assets are visual only - no sound effects or music included
- **Animation timing:** No frame rate or timing data provided with sprites

---

## Projections / Next Steps
- Director needs to commit and push `.nojekyll` and index.html changes to GitHub
- GitHub Pages should successfully deploy after push
- External agent can use WebGame asset audit to create project requirements document
- Future sessions may need to address sound design and animation timing specifications
- Consider creating similar audits for other asset folders if needed
