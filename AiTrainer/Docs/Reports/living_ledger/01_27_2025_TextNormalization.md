# Ledger Entry — January 27, 2025

**Name:** Claude (AI Assistant via Claude Code)
**Date:** January 27, 2025
**Time:** ~11:30 AM PST
**Role:** Development Assistant
**General Subject Matter:** WebGame main.js - UI text normalization + hit logic audit

---

## Summary

Performed scoped, minimal edits to main.js only:
- **Part A:** Normalized UI text layout (drawPixelText calls only) across 6 functions for consistent sizing, spacing, and alignment
- **Part B:** Added logging instrumentation to attack functions and audited hit application logic

**Scope:** main.js only. No images, sprites, audio, animations, or new files touched. All changes reversible.

---

## Part A: UI Text Layout Normalization

### Goal
Make text spacing, alignment, and font sizing consistent across all UI panels and screens.

### Functions Modified (text only)

1. **drawStatPanelsWithIcons()** (lines 547-660)
   - Player panel: Normalized title (24px), labels (20px), stats (20px) with consistent 30px vertical steps
   - Enemy panel: Matched player rhythm exactly - same font sizes, same y-offsets
   - Stats now in uniform left/right columns (x: 10 and 150) with 30px y-step

2. **drawCommandInterface()** (lines 696-763)
   - Title: 10px → 24px (title-sized), centered properly
   - Button text: 15px → 20px, vertically centered using `btnHeight / 2 + 5`

3. **drawMoveSelectionSidePanel()** (lines 768-850)
   - Move names: 20px (bold)
   - Slot text: 10px
   - Description: 10px
   - Right-side stats: 15px, all aligned to single right x-column (`rightStatX`)
   - Consistent y-spacing (30px between name/slot/desc rows)

4. **drawChallengeScreen()** (lines 353-413)
   - Main title: 20px → 28px
   - Enemy name: 20px → 24px
   - "DO YOU ACCEPT?": 20px → 24px

5. **drawPostBattle()** (lines 933-984)
   - Title: 27px → 28px
   - Rewards list: 31/31/31/12 → all 20px (consistent)
   - Line spacing: uniform 30px
   - Integrity status: 24px → 20px
   - Return prompt: 36px → 24px

6. **drawPostBattleWithAnimations()** (lines 854-932)
   - No text changes needed (calls drawPostBattle)

### Pattern Applied
- Titles: ≈24-28px, bold, centered
- Labels (HITS, HEAT): 20px, left-aligned
- Stats (GPU/CPU/IO/NET/MEM): 20px, fixed x-columns with 30px y-steps
- Move buttons: name 20px bold, slot/desc 10px, right stats 15px
- Command buttons: 20px, centered/vertically balanced

### What Was NOT Changed
- Colors (only normalized to #FFFFFF, #CCCCCC, etc. for clarity)
- Box dimensions, widths, heights
- Sprite draw calls
- Commented-out code (left as-is)
- drawPixelText outline behavior (no re-enabling of lineWidth/lineJoin)

## Part B: Battle Hit Logic Audit

### Instrumentation Added

#### executePlayerAttack() (lines 1097-1150)
**After line 1098 (`const result = battle.calculateDamage(...)`):**
```javascript
// [HITCHECK] Log attack result for debugging
console.log("[HITCHECK] attacker=PLAYER hit=%s dmg=%d crit=%s", result.hit, result.damage, !!result.critical);
```

**After line 1125 (hit mutations):**
```javascript
// [APPLY] Log hit application for debugging
console.log("[APPLY] to=ENEMY enemy.integrity=%d player.hits=%d", battle.enemy.integrity, battle.player.hits);
```

#### executeEnemyAttack() (lines 1155-1197)
**After line 1165 (`const result = battle.calculateDamage(...)`):**
```javascript
// [HITCHECK] Log attack result for debugging
console.log("[HITCHECK] attacker=ENEMY hit=%s dmg=%d crit=%s", result.hit, result.damage, !!result.critical);
```

**After line 1178 (hit mutations):**
```javascript
// [APPLY] Log hit application for debugging
console.log("[APPLY] to=PLAYER player.integrity=%d enemy.hits=%d", battle.player.integrity, battle.enemy.hits);
```

### Logic Audit Result: ✅ CORRECT

**Verified:**
- When PLAYER attacks and hits:
  - `battle.player.hits++` ← Player's SCORE increases (correct)
  - `battle.enemy.integrity -= damage` ← Enemy takes damage (correct)

- When ENEMY attacks and hits:
  - `battle.enemy.hits++` ← Enemy's SCORE increases (correct)
  - `battle.player.integrity -= damage` ← Player takes damage (correct)

**Clarification:**
The `.hits` counter represents "how many successful hits THIS side has scored" (the score toward 9-hit win condition). This is the correct interpretation. Both functions apply damage to the DEFENDER while incrementing the ATTACKER's score.

**No fix needed.** Logic was already correct. Added clear comments for future clarity:
- Line 1123-1124: "Regular hit - apply damage to ENEMY and increment PLAYER's score"
- Line 1176-1178: "Enemy hit - increment ENEMY's score and apply damage to PLAYER"

### FLASH_BIOS Special Case
Preserved as-is:
- On miss, only adjusts attacker (`battle.player.hits = Math.max(0, battle.player.hits - 1)`)
- Does not touch defender (correct)

## Files Modified

1. **Q:\FakeDesktop\file\create\Project_BotPop\AiTrainer\WebGame\main.js**
   - Header comment added (line 3)
   - Text normalization in 6 functions (Part A)
   - Logging instrumentation in 2 functions (Part B)
   - Clarifying comments added to hit application logic

**Total files modified:** 1
**No other files touched**

---

## Testing Notes

To validate hit logic with new logging:
1. Open browser console
2. Play a battle
3. Observe logs:
   - `[HITCHECK] attacker=PLAYER hit=true dmg=X crit=false`
   - `[APPLY] to=ENEMY enemy.integrity=Y player.hits=N`
   - `[HITCHECK] attacker=ENEMY hit=true dmg=X crit=false`
   - `[APPLY] to=PLAYER player.integrity=Y enemy.hits=N`

Expected behavior (now verified):
- When player hits: `player.hits` increments, `enemy.integrity` decreases
- When enemy hits: `enemy.hits` increments, `player.integrity` decreases
- No cross-application of hits or integrity changes

---

## Roadblocks
None encountered.

---

## Potential Problems
None identified. All changes minimal, scoped, and reversible. Logging can be removed in future if no longer needed.

---

## Projections / Next Steps
1. User testing with logging enabled to verify hit display matches actual logic
2. If UI display issue is confirmed (not logic), investigate stat panel rendering (possible y-offset or label issue)
3. Logging can be removed once confirmed working correctly

---

## Code Quality Notes

- All text changes preserve existing visual structure
- Uniform vertical rhythm (30px steps) makes future adjustments easier
- Added clear inline comments for hit logic
- Logging uses standardized format for easy parsing
- No breaking changes - all existing functionality preserved
