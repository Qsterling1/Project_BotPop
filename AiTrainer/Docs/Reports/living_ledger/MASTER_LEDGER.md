**Name:** Claude (AI Assistant via Claude Code)
**Date:** January 27, 2025
**Time:** 11:30 AM PST
**Role:** Development Assistant
**General Subject Matter:** WebGame main.js - UI text normalization + hit logic audit/fix

---

## Summary
Performed scoped, minimal edits to main.js only:
- **Part A:** Normalized UI text layout (drawPixelText calls only) across 6 functions for consistent sizing, spacing, and alignment
- **Part B:** Added logging instrumentation and audited hit application logic - confirmed correct, no fix needed

**Result:** All UI text now follows consistent pattern (titles ≈24-28px, labels/stats 20px, uniform 30px vertical rhythm). Battle hit logic verified correct with debugging logs added.

**Files Modified:** main.js only (1 file)

## Summary
Completed comprehensive code annotation of all rendering functions in main.js. Added ~80 `// ADJUST:` comments across 5 major sections to enable user to independently tweak positions, colors, sizes, and layout without assistance.

---

## Details

### Continuation Context
This session continued from previous work where:
- WebGame v3.0 was fully functional (game starts, characters visible, interface working)
- User requested code annotations instead of AI making positioning tweaks
- User's quote: "It'll be difficult for you to tweak all these things over and over so you can just clearly explain to me in the code and where in the code to annotate the and change the locations myself."

### Sections Annotated

**1. Hit/Miss Animation System (Lines 629-662):**
- Animation sprite size (scale multiplier)
- X/Y positioning (centered horizontally by default)

### Annotation Format Standards

**Section Headers:**
```javascript
// ============================================================================
// SECTION NAME - ANCHOR DESCRIPTION
// ============================================================================
```

**Adjustable Values:**
```javascript
const panelX = 10;                                               // ADJUST: Distance from left edge
const panelY = 10;                                               // ADJUST: Distance from top edge
const panelW = 300;                                              // ADJUST: Panel width
ctx.fillStyle = 'rgba(78, 205, 196, 0.8)';                      // ADJUST: Panel background color (R, G, B, opacity)
```

**Text Rendering:**
```javascript
drawPixelText('TITLE', x, y, 22, '#4ECDC4', 'center', true);    // ADJUST: Title position & size & color
```

### Anchor System Implementation

All UI elements now documented with anchor points:
- **ANCHORED TOP-LEFT:** Player stat panel, back button (menu)
- **ANCHORED TOP-RIGHT:** Enemy stat panel
- **ANCHORED BOTTOM:** Command interface (full width)
- **ANCHORED BOTTOM-LEFT:** Tabia character
- **ANCHORED BOTTOM-RIGHT:** Play button (menu)
- **ANCHORED BOTTOM-CENTER-LEFT:** Player bot (MarqueeBot)
- **ANCHORED BOTTOM-CENTER-RIGHT:** Enemy bot
- **ANCHORED RIGHT:** Move selection side panel (full height)

### User Benefits

**Search Capability:**
User can search for "ADJUST" in code to find all ~80 customizable parameters.

**Self-Service Adjustments:**
User can now independently modify:
- Character positions and sizes
- UI panel positions and dimensions
- Text sizes and colors
- Button layouts and spacing
- Border colors and thicknesses
- Background colors and opacities
- Animation timings and sizes
- All RGBA color values

**Documentation:**
Each adjustment includes:
- What the value controls

# Ledger Entry — October 25, 2025 — 4:42 AM (Pacific Daylight Time)

**Name:** Codex (AI Assistant via Codex CLI)
**Date:** October 25, 2025
**Time:** 4:42 AM PDT
**Role:** External Development Assistant
**General Subject Matter:** Attempted Warm-Up Battle web module build; result diverged from reference mocks and failed QA.

---

## Summary
Produced a standalone Warm-Up Battle HTML/CSS/JS module with audio/VFX hooks, but the delivered scene does not match the provided mock-scene references and key sprites failed to render during user validation. Work is considered a failed attempt pending full redesign against supplied screenshots.

---

## Details
- Implemented new WebGame module with procedural battle flow
- Layout uses HUD frames but composition/sprite placement do not align with mock scenes
- Character sprites often absent/misaligned
- Typography palette diverges from mock
- UI boxes lack exact top-banner treatment
- User reported "nothing works"

---

## Roadblocks
- Did not load Tabia/coach sprite layer
- HUD recreation omitted top badge components
- No baseline timing/spec documentation

---

## Potential Problems
- Current implementation risks further drift
- Audio generated procedurally
- Need to realign asset manifest with mock-specific composites

---

## Projections / Next Steps
- Reconcile canvas rendering with mock scenes
- Rebuild rendering pipeline to match perspective and scale
- Extract UI badge sprites to replicate top HUD exactly
- Re-test with user-supplied references
